# List of english contractions with apostrophes. They don't match for searching in text_proper fields when

# Consulted : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_English_contractions

# This list isn't complete. leading contractions (eg 'cause) aren't needed.
# I didn't include any compound contractions (eg couldn't've).
# Others on the page above weren't included because I didn't find examples of it in our current catalog
# and thought we might never (eg ne'er, e'er [those two surprised me though]).
