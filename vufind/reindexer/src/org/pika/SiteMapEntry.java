	* So you need to either have a set of SiteMaps (1 per scope) or update SiteMapEntry to include the scope and then have a list of works within the SiteMapEntry.  The first option is probably better.
	* When you add a grouped work to a SiteMap you will need to loop through all of the scopes that you are building sitemaps for and check each scope to see if the record isLibraryOwned.  The logic will be similar to the logic in: updateIndexingStats.
