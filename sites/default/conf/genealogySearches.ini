; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
default_handler      = Keyword    ; Search handler to use if none is specified

; This setting controls the default sort order of search results if no search-
; specific setting was present in the [DefaultSortingByType] section below; the
; selected option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section
; below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only 
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be 
; recognized regardless of case.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:ResultsTop:genealogyFacets
default_side_recommend[] = SideFacets:Results::genealogyFacets

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of most pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with a
; search handler (either DisMax or from conf/searchspecs.yaml).  The value of
; each setting is the text to display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run
; through the translator, so be sure to update language files if necessary.  The
; order of these settings will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
;
; Note: The search type of "tag" is a special case that gets handled differently
;       because tags are not stored in the same index as everything else.  Treat
;       this as a reserved word if you create your own custom search handlers.
[Basic_Searches]
GenealogyKeyword      = Keyword
GenealogyName         = Name

; This section defines which search options will be included on the advanced
; search screen.  All the notes above [Basic_Searches] also apply here.
[Advanced_Searches]
Keyword             = adv_search_keyword
Title               = adv_search_title
Author              = adv_search_author
Subject             = adv_search_subject
year                = adv_search_year

; This section defines the sort options available on standard search results.
; Values on the left of the equal sign are either the reserved term "relevance"
; or the name of a Solr index to use for sorting; asc and desc modifiers may be 
; used in combination with index names, but not relevance.  Values on the right 
; of the equal sign are text that will be run through the translation module and 
; displayed on screen.
;
; Note: "year", "author" and "title" are special shortcut aliases for the
;       "publishDate", "authorStr" and "title_sort" Solr fields; you can use 
;       either form in this file.
[Sorting]
relevance = sort_relevance
lastName = Last Name
firstName = First Name
deathYear desc= Year of Death
deathYear asc = "Year of Death Asc"
birthYear desc= Year of Birth
birthYear asc = "Year of Birth Asc"


; Each search type defined in searchspecs.yaml can have one or more "recommendations
; modules" associated with it in the following sections.  These plug-ins will cause
; boxes of suggestions to appear beside (in [SideRecommendations]) or above (in
; [TopRecommendations]) the search results.  You can repeat the line to display a
; series of recommendations boxes in a particular section -- just be sure to include
; brackets ("[]") after the search type name.  If you do not want recommendations
; for a particular search type, set the value to "false" in either or both sections.
; Any search types not listed here will use the default value -- see the
; default_top_recommend and default_side_recommend settings in the [General]
; section above.  It is legal to set the default options to false if you want no
; default value.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the side area:
;
; SideFacets:[regular facet section]:[checkbox facet section]:[ini name]
;       Display the specified facets, where [ini name] is the name of an ini file
;       in web/conf (defaults to "facets" if not supplied), [regular facet section]
;       is the name of a section of the ini file containing standard facet settings
;       (defaults to "Results" if not specified), and [checkbox facet section] is 
;       the name of a section of the ini file containing checkbox facet settings 
;       (leave blank for no checkbox facets).
; SummonDatabases:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated database recommendations matching the terms found 
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display Summon search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the top area:

; You can build your own recommendations modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
